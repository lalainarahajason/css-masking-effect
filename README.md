# css-masking-effect
Mask text with css, javascript is here only to make an element following mouse coordinates, so totally optional

# The technique
The technique is rather simple, it's about superimposing two blocks of text and playing with the z-index, the text above is positioned in absolute so that it can be placed just above the other one, and in the middle you can pass any element to enjoy the effect, here it's a simple div according to the position of the mouse and is placed between the two texts (z-index:2)
